Todo app is part of an assigment made in the context of Compose Masterclass course by Philipp Lackner
This is my approach to solving the requirements he made for the assignment
- Todo list app with checkbox that once it is checked strikesthrough the assignment
- Possibility to delete todos
- Possibility to add todo

Disclaimers
- For the purpose of the assigment the Todos are saved in app memory, later I can integrate a database for storage
- This is an offline app
